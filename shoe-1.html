                a running shoe.It gained popularity as casual wear because of its simple design in comparison to the technical running footwear 
                designs that followed the Classic Leather's release.A print advertisement showing a couple on a motorcycle with the tag line 
                "You've Arrived" was created for the shoe.<br>That year, the Newport Classic (NPC) and Ex-O-Fit were launched.
